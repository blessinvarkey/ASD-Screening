Since 2013, I have been working with Educational Technology and Accessibility products, as a senior product and research manager. I also have experience of working with a range of multidisciplinary teams for both research and product innovation. In 2015 for developing a sensor based application for p/w disabilities, I was recognized as a social innovator by [NASSCOM](https://nasscomfoundation.org/nsif-winners/winner-kinect-based-applications-tamana/). My research interests/publications cover areas including: Human-Computer Interaction, Social Computing, Accessibility and Artificial Intelligence.
