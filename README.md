### [Gaze-based Screening of Autistic Traits for Adolescents and Young Adults using Prosaic Videos](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3378393.3402242)

**Abstract**

> Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a universal and often lifelong neuro-developmental disorder. Individuals with ASD often present comorbidities such as epilepsy, depression, and anxiety. In the United States, in 2014, 1 out of 68 people was affected by autism, but worldwide, the number of affected people drops to 1 in 160. This disparity is primarily due to underdiagnosis and unreported cases in resource-constrained environments. Wiggins et al. 1 found that, in the US, children of color are under-identified with ASD. Missing a diagnosis is not without consequences; approximately 26% of adults with ASD are under-employed, and are under-enrolled in higher education. Unfortunately, ASD diagnosis is not straightforward and involves a subjective assessment of the patient's behavior. Because such assessments can be noisy and even non-existent in low-resource environments, many cases go unidentified. Many such cases remain undiagnosed even when the patient reaches adolescence or adulthood. There is a need for an objective, low-cost, and ubiquitous approach to diagnose ASD. Autism is often characterized by symptoms such as limited interpersonal and social communication skills, and difficulty in face recognition and emotion interpretation. When watching video media, these symptoms can manifest as reduced eye fixation, resulting in characteristic gaze behaviors. Thus, we developed an approach to screen patients with ASD using their gaze behavior while they watch videos on a laptop screen. We used a dedicated eye tracker to record the participant's gaze. With data from 60 participants (35 with ASD and 25 without ASD), our algorithm demonstrates 92.5% classification accuracy after the participants watched 15 seconds of the video. We also developed a proof-of-concept regression model that estimates the severity of the condition and achieves a mean absolute error of 2.03 on the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS). One of the most common approaches to identify individuals with ASD involves studying family home videos and investigating an infant's gaze and interactions with their families. However, having an expert carefully inspect hours of home video is expensive and unscalable. Our approach is more accessible and ubiquitous as we can directly sense the gaze of the user while they watch videos. Such sensing can be directly deployed on billions of smartphones around the world that are equipped with a front-facing camera. In our current exploration, we use a dedicated eye-tracker but achieving similar performance using an unmodified s martphone c amera is not far-fetched. Our results demonstrate that passively tracking a user's gaze pattern while they watch videos on a screen can enable robust identification of individuals with ASD. Past work has used specially-created visual content to detect ASD, but getting large sets of the population to watch specific videos is hard. Thus, we focus on generic content and selected four prosaic video scenes as a proof of concept. Our research team includes experienced psychologists to inform the study design and contextualize the performance of the final system. Although our gaze tracking approach cannot yet replace a clinical assessment, we believe it could be valuable for screening individuals passively, as they consume media content on computing devices (e.g., YouTube, Netflix, in-game cut scenes). We believe our efforts in estimating condition severity is also an essential first step towards building an entirely automated, in-home screening, and condition management tool. With rapid advancements in gaze tracking on consumer devices (e.g., Apple iPhone, HTC Vive), autism detection could be included on modern computing devices as a downloadable app or background feature, and potentially reduce the number of undiagnosed cases. Such a system could also track the efficacy of treatment and interventions. Additionally, ASD detection could be used to automatically adapt user interfaces, which has been shown to improve accessibility.


### [VisualMath: An Automated Visualization System for Understanding Math Word-Problems](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3030024.3040989)
> Math word problems are difficult for students to start with since they involve understanding the problem? s context and abstracting out its underlying mathematical operations. A visual understanding of the problem at hand can be very useful for the comprehension of the problem. We present a system VisualMath that uses machine learning tools and crafted visual logic to automatically generate appropriate visualizations from the text of the word-problems and solve it. We demonstrate the improvements in the understanding of math word-problems by conducting a user study and learning of meaning of relevant new words by students.

### [Promoting joint attention with computer supported collaboration in children with autism](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2982142.2982166)

**Abstract**

> There exists mounting evidence in favor of computer supported autism interventions at the individual level. However, the potential benefits of using computer supported collaboration to encourage social interactions between individuals with autism and typically developed individuals are underexplored, particularly in developing regions. We present an exploratory study of a collaborative gesture-based application, Balloons. The application encourages joint attention, which is defined as the shared attention between two individuals towards the same object. Using mixed methods, we evaluated Balloons for three weeks in New Delhi with ten medium-low functioning autistic children. Our findings suggest that employing CSC interventions for children with autism in India provide (a) observable improvements in social interaction with typically developed peers, (b) the opportunity to customize and individualize intervention to cater to a large spectrum of children and (c) the potential opportunity of reducing fears of certain objects.

### [Designing gesture-based applications for individuals with developmental disabilities: guidelines from user studies in India](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3161710)

**Abstract**

> Gesture interaction provides a multitude of benefits to individuals with developmental disabilities, from enhancing social, motor and cognitive skills to providing a safe and controlled environment for simulating real-world scenarios. As gesture-based applications gain ground in the special education domain, we study their potential in the Indian context. Together with Tamana, an NGO in New Delhi, we have been conducting a series of exploratory user studies since October 2013. This includes the design and evaluation of three gesture-based applications to impart social and life skills to individuals with developmental disabilities. The Kirana application employs socially appropriate gestures to teach the life skill of buying day-to-day items from a local Indian grocery. Balloons promotes joint attention skills through collaborative interaction. HOPE improves motor coordination and social and cognitive skills, with increasing levels of difficulty. Based on studies with these applications, this article presents guidelines for designing gesture-based applications for individuals with developmental disabilities. The guidelines focus on (a) designing applications that cater to a larger group of individuals to encourage collaboration and inclusion, for instance, providing easy and controllable transitions between different task levels, and balancing interaction and content complexity; (b) addressing the challenges in conducting research in this domain, with respect to ethical and procedural decisions; and (c) designing for technology acceptance within the Indian context, for example, by following a collaborative and stakeholder inclusive approach, and addressing apprehensions towards technology adoption. These guidelines aim to benefit other practitioners working in this domain and especially in the educational technology context of India.


### [Computer assisted autism interventions for india](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3010915.3011007)

**Abstract**

> Early intervention is critical for children with autism. To provide affordable computer assisted therapies for developing countries, we construct infrastructures for translating and adapting early intervention programs such as TOBY to an Indian context. A Hindi prototype is built and two trials are conducted, showing that the technology was accepted and that the children learnt skills using both language versions, with the children using the Hindi prototype achieving slightly better measurable outcomes.
