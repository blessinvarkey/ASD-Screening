### About

As the Innovation & Research Lead at Tamana, I have worked with a range of multidisciplinary teams for both research and product innovation. As a social innovator, my work at Tamana was recognized by [NASSCOM](https://nasscomfoundation.org/nsif-winners/winner-kinect-based-applications-tamana/) in 2015 for developing HOPE, a Kinect based application for individuals with developmental disabilities. Over the last seven years, I have worked on various HCI, AI and Accessibility projects with researchers from Deakin University, Australia, IBM Research India, NIOS Research, MoSJE Research; University of Tampere & Microsoft India for developing applied, accessible and educational solutions. My research interests/publications during the same, can be found [here](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=LyH1LVAAAAAJ&hl=en). As a speaker, I have been invited to speak on accessibility at the Microsoft Enabling Opportunities Summit in Singapore, Proyash in Bangladesh, SIGACCESS in USA, Digital Impact Square - TCS, IIIT-D, SOIL to name a few. I am also a member of ACM and SIGACCESS.
