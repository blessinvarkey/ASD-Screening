### [Promoting joint attention with computer supported collaboration in children with autism](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2982142.2982166)

**Abstract**

> There exists mounting evidence in favor of computer supported autism interventions at the individual level. However, the potential benefits of using computer supported collaboration to encourage social interactions between individuals with autism and typically developed individuals are underexplored, particularly in developing regions. We present an exploratory study of a collaborative gesture-based application, Balloons. The application encourages joint attention, which is defined as the shared attention between two individuals towards the same object. Using mixed methods, we evaluated Balloons for three weeks in New Delhi with ten medium-low functioning autistic children. Our findings suggest that employing CSC interventions for children with autism in India provide (a) observable improvements in social interaction with typically developed peers, (b) the opportunity to customize and individualize intervention to cater to a large spectrum of children and (c) the potential opportunity of reducing fears of certain objects.

### [Designing gesture-based applications for individuals with developmental disabilities: guidelines from user studies in India](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3161710)

**Abstract**

> Gesture interaction provides a multitude of benefits to individuals with developmental disabilities, from enhancing social, motor and cognitive skills to providing a safe and controlled environment for simulating real-world scenarios. As gesture-based applications gain ground in the special education domain, we study their potential in the Indian context. Together with Tamana, an NGO in New Delhi, we have been conducting a series of exploratory user studies since October 2013. This includes the design and evaluation of three gesture-based applications to impart social and life skills to individuals with developmental disabilities. The Kirana application employs socially appropriate gestures to teach the life skill of buying day-to-day items from a local Indian grocery. Balloons promotes joint attention skills through collaborative interaction. HOPE improves motor coordination and social and cognitive skills, with increasing levels of difficulty. Based on studies with these applications, this article presents guidelines for designing gesture-based applications for individuals with developmental disabilities. The guidelines focus on (a) designing applications that cater to a larger group of individuals to encourage collaboration and inclusion, for instance, providing easy and controllable transitions between different task levels, and balancing interaction and content complexity; (b) addressing the challenges in conducting research in this domain, with respect to ethical and procedural decisions; and (c) designing for technology acceptance within the Indian context, for example, by following a collaborative and stakeholder inclusive approach, and addressing apprehensions towards technology adoption. These guidelines aim to benefit other practitioners working in this domain and especially in the educational technology context of India.


### [Computer assisted autism interventions for india](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3010915.3011007)

**Abstract**

> Early intervention is critical for children with autism. To provide affordable computer assisted therapies for developing countries, we construct infrastructures for translating and adapting early intervention programs such as TOBY to an Indian context. A Hindi prototype is built and two trials are conducted, showing that the technology was accepted and that the children learnt skills using both language versions, with the children using the Hindi prototype achieving slightly better measurable outcomes.
