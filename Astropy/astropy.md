### AstroPy 
The AstroPy blog is part of the amatuer astronomy blog I started this year called Quasars & Cosmos. This page will have all the Python projects uploaded for astronomy. Meanwhile, check out [my blog](http://quasarsandcosmos.wordpress.com/) and share your feedback.  


### Quasars and Cosmos (Blog)

### IV. [12 Things to Spot in the Urban Night Sky](https://quasarsandcosmos.wordpress.com/2020/11/17/12-things-to-see-in-the-urban-night-sky/)
“The nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth, the iron in our blood, the carbon in our apple pies were made in the interiors of collapsing stars. We are made of starstuff.” – Carl Sagan, Cosmos. Ever looked up at the urban night sky and wished if you could see the stars? or wondered what the names of the visible stars are? In this post, I’m going to help you identify some stars that you can spot from wherever you are, provided you can see the night sky.

### III. [Pleiades Star Cluster & The Taurids](https://quasarsandcosmos.wordpress.com/2020/10/30/pleiades-star-cluster-the-taurids/)
Stargazing on a hilly, chilly night by yourself can be a real test of patience. So, its always better to organize a star party with your friends, who could make the stargazing, less unbearable. All you need is enough water, some snacks, a pair of (porro prism) binoculars, a red torch and a box to lock all the phones/ devices to make the star party or the celestial observation experience, memorable. If you are going for meteor showers it will be good to dial back any expectations you have as they tend to be sporadic.

### II. [Perseids : The Debris of Comet Swift-Tuttle](https://quasarsandcosmos.wordpress.com/2020/08/22/the-debris-of-comet-swift-tuttle/)
Perseids (Per-see-ids) is the brightest, annual meteor showers which starts late July and ends mid-August. The meteor showers seem to originate from the constellation Perseus, however the stars forming the constellation are light years away from the Perseids stream. The celestial point in the sky from which meteors appear is called the radiant – which in case of Persieds, appears in the Perseus constellation. The Perseids meteors originate from the Perseids meteorid stream (see image below), which constitutes the leftover particles of the largest known Earth crossing periodic comet, the 109P/Swift-Tuttle.

### I. [The Quest for Comet Neowise](https://quasarsandcosmos.wordpress.com/2020/07/30/the-quest-for-comet-neowise/)
[...] However, after three weeks, I finally got a clear night sky and was able to spot the faint greenish comet with my (15 x 70) binoculars. Its hard to spot its tail now even with aided eyes, but to be able to see it finally was quite satisfying. In case you are reading this in the first half of August, just borrow a pair of good binoculars and look for the Coma Berenices constellation, an hour after sunset. If you are in a light polluted area, you might have to stare at the night sky for a few minutes (without looking at your phone and avoiding the street lights) to get your eyes adapted to the dark. In low light, the pupils widen to let more light in, and in doing so you’ll be able to see more stars. If you are using a stargazing app to track the comet, use its red light mode to avoid losing your night vision. You can also follow [this twitter account](https://twitter.com/c2020f3) to keep a track of the current position and brightness of the comet.
